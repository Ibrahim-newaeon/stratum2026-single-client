# ADs Growth System — Enterprise System Features Audit

**Date:** 2026-05-30
**Branch:** `claude/system-features-audit-DiYfj`
**Scope:** Every system feature audited end-to-end (frontend view → API client → backend endpoint → service/model/worker → tests).
**Method:** 9 parallel domain auditors, each grounded in `file:line` evidence. The highest-severity, falsifiable claims were independently re-verified by the lead auditor (noted ✅ below). Nothing here is assumed — where something could not be confirmed it is marked **UNVERIFIED**.

---

## 1. Executive Verdict

ADs Growth System is a **genuinely large, substantially-built platform** — ~67 wired API endpoint domains, ~50 frontend views, ~40 service modules, 1,867 test functions, 49 migrations. It is **not** a skeleton or a demo: the hard algorithmic cores (Markov/Shapley attribution, sklearn ML training, EMQ math, signal-health scoring, identity resolution, OAuth token exchange, audience PII hashing, autopilot enforcement, Stripe billing) are **real implementations**, not stubs.

**However, it is not production-ready as a whole.** The failure pattern is consistent and important: **strong components are let down by wiring, enforcement, and persistence gaps.** Repeatedly, an excellent backend is not reached by the frontend (route mismatches), a real engine is never triggered by a scheduler (orphaned workers), security machinery is defined but never applied (feature gates, MFA, API-key auth), or data is computed but never persisted (audit log, profit metrics, reallocation plans).

**Overall platform readiness: ~62% — "advanced beta."** Roughly one-third of features are go-live ready or close (A/B+). One-third work but have material gaps (B/C). One-third are stubs, broken, or unenforced (D/F) and would mislead a customer if shipped as-is.

| Severity                                  | Count | Examples                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🟢 Ship-ready / near (A / A-)             | ~9    | OAuth, Audience Sync, CDP core, Attribution, Launch Readiness, CMS                                                         |
| 🟡 Works, material gaps (B / B+)          | ~16   | Payments, WhatsApp, Dashboard, RBAC, Multi-tenancy, Autopilot Enforcement                                                  |
| 🟠 Real but unenforced/partial (C)        | ~14   | EMQ, Rules, API Keys, Feature Flags, Reporting, Webhooks, QA-Fixes                                                         |
| 🔴 Stub / broken / non-functional (D / F) | ~14   | Campaign publish, Drip, Push, Developer Portal, Compliance, Audit Logging, Knowledge Graph, Competitor Intel, MFA-at-login |

## 2. Cross-Cutting Blockers (fix these once, fix many features)

These are systemic — each one breaks multiple features and should be prioritized over individual feature fixes.

### P0 — Security / data-integrity (must fix before any production traffic)

| #    | Blocker                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Evidence                                                                                            | Features affected                                 |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| P0-1 | **MFA is never enforced at login.** `/login` issues full tokens without any TOTP check; `Login.tsx` has no MFA step. The entire MFA subsystem is unreachable.                                                                                                                          | `auth.py:535,611`; `mfa.py` `/validate` has no caller                                               | Authentication, MFA                               |
| P0-2 | **Cross-tenant IDOR in multiple endpoints.** `tenants.py` admin routes act on arbitrary `tenant_id` with no caller-match; `newsletter.py` ignores `tenant_id` entirely (✅ 0 occurrences); `predictions.py`/`analytics_ai.py`/`copilot.py` default to **tenant 1** on missing context. | `tenants.py:149,268,342`; `newsletter.py` (0× tenant_id ✅); `predictions.py:139`; `copilot.py:203` | Tenancy, Newsletter, Predictions, Copilot         |
| P0-3 | **Audit logging is broken end-to-end.** Middleware is registered and pushes to Redis `audit_log_queue`; worker reads `audit:log:queue` — **keys never match, events silently dropped** (✅ verified). No tamper-evidence (no hash chain) despite the claim.                            | `middleware/audit.py:239` vs `workers/tasks/audit.py:33` ✅; `base_models.py:899`                   | Compliance, SuperAdmin, all mutations             |
| P0-4 | **API keys cannot authenticate anything.** CRUD mints keys, but no middleware/dependency ever validates an inbound key; `verify_api_key` is never called in production code.                                                                                                           | `api_keys.py`; `security.py:290` (no callers)                                                       | API Keys, Developer Portal                        |
| P0-5 | **Tier / feature gating is inert.** `FeatureGate`/`TierGate`/`require_feature` are applied to **0** endpoints (✅ 0 usages). A free/expired tenant can call enterprise features.                                                                                                       | `core/feature_gate.py` (0× in `app/api/` ✅)                                                        | Subscription, Feature Flags, all premium features |
| P0-6 | **Plaintext secrets at rest.** Slack `webhook_url` stored plaintext; license HMAC fallback uses hardcoded `"dev-secret-change-me"` with no prod guard.                                                                                                                                 | `models/settings.py:308`; `licensing.py:259`                                                        | Slack, Licensing                                  |

### P1 — Functional integrity (feature claims are false until fixed)

| #    | Blocker                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Evidence                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Features affected                                       |

| P1-1 | **Frontend↔backend route-prefix mismatches → 404s on wired UI.** The API client injects tenant as a header, never into the path, but several backend routers use `/tenant/{tenant_id}/...` prefixes. (✅ verified for autopilot/trust.)                                      | `autopilot.ts:93` `/autopilot/status` vs `autopilot.py:25` `/tenant/{id}/autopilot`; trust-layer, pacing, CRM, competitors, knowledge-graph clients                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Autopilot, Trust Layer, Pacing, CRM, Competitors, KG    |
| P1-2 | **Orphaned workers / schedulers.** Real engines exist but nothing triggers them: reporting scheduler (no beat task), drip campaigns (no worker), profit `DailyProfitMetrics` (no writer), campaign-builder beat (commented out), CAPI delivery logger + DLQ (never invoked). | `celery_app.py:74`; `scheduler.py`; `campaign_builder_tasks.py:404`; `delivery_logger.py`/`dead_letter_queue.py` (0 call sites)                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Reporting, Drip, Profit, Campaign Builder, CAPI         |

| P1-5 | **Built-but-unwired / dual implementations (dead code creating confusion).** stratum ad-adapters never registered; two trust mechanisms (rich `TrustGate` bypassed by live path); legacy + AGE knowledge-graph services; embed-widgets backend never called by frontend.     | `register_default_adapters()` (0 startup calls); `autopilot/service.py:90`; `EmbedWidgets.tsx` (0 network calls)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Adapters, Trust, KG, Embed Widgets                      |

### P2 — Test & coverage debt

- CLAUDE.md mandates **90%+ coverage** for `core/`, `autopilot/`, `analytics/`. Reality: strong suites exist for CDP, Audience Sync, Campaign Builder (validates a stub), Auth, Analytics-logic, Copilot, Launch Readiness, CMS. **Near-zero tests** for: Payments/Stripe, Tier/Subscription, WhatsApp, Slack, Push, Profit, Assets, Campaigns CRUD, Newsletter, Drip, Embed, Onboarding, GDPR, Compliance, SuperAdmin, Webhooks, Feature Flags, Rules engine, Pacing, Markov/Shapley core math, ML training output.

## 4. Security Findings (consolidated)

**Strengths (genuinely well done):** bcrypt + 72-byte truncation, JWT HS256 with refresh rotation + Redis blacklist + login lockout, no PII in JWT claims, Fernet PII encryption with per-tenant salt, `secrets` for tokens, `hmac.compare_digest` constant-time compares, JWT `none`-algorithm attack test, production secret-value rejection, Stripe + WhatsApp webhook signature verification, embed-widget token theft detection, webhook SSRF guard, mock-data forbidden in production env.

**Must-fix before go-live:**

1. Enforce MFA at login (P0-1).
2. Close cross-tenant IDOR: `tenants.py`, newsletter, `predictions`/`analytics_ai`/`copilot` tenant-`1` fallbacks (P0-2).
3. Gate ML-training endpoints with auth + superadmin + tenant-namespaced paths + upload validation (Domain 4).
4. Wire feature/tier/subscription enforcement (P0-5).
5. Encrypt Slack webhook URL; guard license HMAC secret in prod (P0-6).
6. Add API-key inbound authenticator (P0-4).
7. Add `redirect_uri` allowlist on OAuth callback; sign outbound webhook payloads.

---

## 5. What's Needed to Go Live — Prioritized Roadmap

**Phase 0 — Security & data integrity (blocking):** P0-1…P0-6 above + ML-training auth.

**Phase 1 — Make claimed features actually function:**

- Fix the route-prefix mismatches (P1-1) — one client-side path convention or align router prefixes.
- Wire the orphaned workers (P1-2): reporting beat task, drip worker, profit `DailyProfitMetrics` writer, campaign-publish task, CAPI delivery logger + DLQ.
- Fix the 7 runtime crash bugs (P1-3).
- Replace in-memory state with DB/Redis (P1-4) for CAPI, reallocation, drip, push, Stripe idempotency.
- Implement real campaign publish (stop faking success).
- Provision Apache AGE (or move KG migration into the active tree + AGE-enabled image) or shelve KG (P1-6).
- Fix competitor worker to use the real scraper/market_proxy (and fix the SyntaxError).

**Phase 2 — Coverage & operationalization:**

- Add tests for the ~20 untested features (Payments, WhatsApp, Profit, Newsletter, GDPR, Compliance, SuperAdmin, Markov/Shapley, ML output, Rules, Pacing…).
- Set & document operational keys: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY` (+ flip Copilot flags + run doc-index), Stripe price IDs/webhook secret, per-platform OAuth app credentials, SendGrid, WeasyPrint native libs, S3 for assets.
- Reconcile dual implementations (trust mechanisms, KG, adapters); delete dead code.
- Wire Embed Widgets frontend to its backend.

**Phase 3 — Scale hardening:**

- Move synchronous in-request batch jobs (segment/trait/funnel/RFM compute, audience sync) to Celery.
- Add Postgres RLS as defense-in-depth behind the app-level tenant filters.
- Tamper-evident audit log (hash chain / HMAC) if compliance requires it.

## 6. Related Skills / Agents per Gap Cluster

The repo ships project skills and review subagents that map directly onto these gaps — use them to execute the roadmap consistently:

| Pre-deploy verification (lint/tests/migrations/thresholds)                                 | `deploy-check` skill                                    |
| Production incidents (queue, gate stuck, pool)                                             | `incident-response` skill                               |

## 7. What I Could NOT Verify (honesty log)

- **Live external API behavior** — OAuth token exchange, platform sync field mappings, WhatsApp/Stripe/SendGrid against real services (all tests mock the SDKs).
- **Whether `.pkl` ML models ship in the deploy image** — ROAS/simulator/predictions fall back to constants if absent.
- **Whether fact tables are populated** — `FactSignalHealthDaily`, `FactAttributionVarianceDaily`, `DailyProfitMetrics`, `DailyPipelineMetrics` are read everywhere but the populating pipelines weren't all located.
- **Production env configuration** — which secrets/keys are actually set in the deployed environment.
- **Test pass rate** — the 1,867 tests were inventoried, not executed in this audit.
- **Test coverage** for GDPR, Compliance, SuperAdmin, Webhooks, Feature Flags, Changelog (none found in the named suites).
- **Whether `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` is reachable** from the deploy environment.
- **CMS scheduled-publish beat task**, embed loader.js serving endpoint, onboarding-agent `complete` provisioning — not located.

These are tractable to close with environment access and a test run; flag any you want investigated next.
