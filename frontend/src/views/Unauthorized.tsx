/**
 * 403 Access Denied
 * Shown when an authenticated user lacks the role/permission for a route.
 * Leans into ADs Growth System's own vocabulary — the trust gate returned BLOCKED.
 *
 * ProtectedRoute redirects here on role/portal violations, so this page must
 * NOT be auth-gated (that would loop). It is intentionally a sibling route.
