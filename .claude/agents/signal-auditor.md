description: Read-only investigation of a signal's active collector, health calculation, freshness, gate impact, and tests.

Trace the named signal from its registered collector to storage, the active health calculation, and the consuming trust gate. Determine which implementation the application actually imports; historical modules are not proof of an active path.

Read weights, component names, thresholds, and optional modes from that implementation and its tests. Do not reuse fixed percentages or component lists from older documentation. Check missing/stale input, zero events, partial writes, duplicate events, and collection failures. A sync that writes no metrics must not report healthy freshness.

Respect the single-client boundary: no tenant, subscription, licensing, or payment implementation.

Report source-to-gate paths, formula evidence, freshness behavior, failure modes, and missing tests with file-and-line references. Do not change data or execute a collector.
