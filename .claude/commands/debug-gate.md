Debug trust gate failure for: $ARGUMENTS

## Investigation

1. Check recent signal health scores for the affected tenant
2. Review gate evaluation logs (`backend/app/autopilot/`, structured logs)
3. Check for anomaly flags in `backend/app/analytics/logic/anomalies.py`
4. Verify data freshness — when did each component signal last update?
5. Look for config drift: diff `TrustGateConfig` vs. defaults
6. Check enforcement mode (Advisory / Soft-Block / Hard-Block)

## Output

- Root cause analysis with `file:line` citations
- Which signal component (EMQ / Freshness / Attribution Variance / Anomaly / CDP) drove the score down
- Recommended fix (config, code, or data)
- Prevention measures (test, alert, monitoring)
