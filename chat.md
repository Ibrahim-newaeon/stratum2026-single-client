# ADs Growth System Development Session - February 4, 2026

## Session Summary

This session continued from a previous conversation and focused on:
1. CDP (Customer Data Platform) feature testing
2. Fixing route ordering bug

---

## CDP Feature Testing

### Demo User Setup

Created demo user for testing:
- **Email:** demo@stratum.ai
- **Password:** DemoPassword123
- **Tenant:** Demo Company (ID: 4)

### CDP Features Tested

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| CDP Health | ✅ Working | Returns module version 1.1.0 |
| Event Ingestion | ✅ Working | Auto-creates profiles, EMQ scoring |
| Profile Query | ✅ Working | Query by identifier type/value |
| Identity Graph | ✅ Working | Shows nodes (identifiers) and edges (links) |
| Event Trends | ✅ Working | Period comparison with trend analysis |
| Segments CRUD | ✅ Working | Create, list, delete segments |
| Funnels CRUD | ✅ Working | Create, list funnels with steps |
| Anomaly Detection | ✅ Working | Event volume anomaly analysis |
| Anomaly Summary | ✅ Working | Health status with WoW comparison |
| Audience Export | ✅ Working | JSON export with optional traits |
| Audience Sync Platforms | ✅ Working | Lists connected platforms |

### Test Data Created
- **Profile:** 1 profile with 3 identifiers (anonymous_id, email, external_id)
- **Events:** 3 events (page_view, identify, purchase)
- **Segment:** "Active Users" segment
- **Funnel:** "Purchase Funnel" with 3 steps

## Bug Fix: Route Ordering

### Problem
Routes `/profiles/statistics` and `/profiles/search` were being caught by `/profiles/{profile_id}` route, causing UUID parsing errors.

**Error:**
```
Input should be a valid UUID, invalid character: expected an optional prefix of
`urn:uuid:` followed by [0-9a-fA-F-], found `s` at 1
```

### Solution
Moved `/profiles/{profile_id}` route definition from line 752 to after specific routes (statistics, search, merge) at line 2773.

**File:** `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/cdp.py`

Added comment explaining the route ordering requirement:
```python
# =============================================================================
# Profile by ID Endpoint
# NOTE: This route MUST come after /profiles/statistics, /profiles/search,
# and /profiles/merge to avoid route conflicts with FastAPI's path matching.
# =============================================================================
```

### Commit
```
29b9b39 fix(cdp): fix route ordering bug for /profiles/* endpoints
```

## Voice Greeting Implementation

### Status Before
- VoiceGreeting React component: ✅ Fully built
- Audio files: ❌ Missing
- Landing page integration: ✅ Configured

### Implementation
Generated audio files using Microsoft Edge TTS (edge-tts Python library):

**English Greeting (`greeting-en.mp3` - 57KB):**
```
Hi there! Welcome to ADs Growth System. I am here to help you get started
with our Revenue Operating System. Want to chat?
```
Voice: `en-US-JennyNeural`

**Arabic Greeting (`greeting-ar.mp3` - 70KB):**
```
مرحباً! أهلاً بك في ADs Growth System. أنا هنا لمساعدتك في البدء مع نظام
تشغيل الإيرادات. هل تريد الدردشة؟
```
Voice: `ar-SA-ZariyahNeural`

### Files Created
```
frontend/public/audio/
├── greeting-en.mp3
└── greeting-ar.mp3
```

### Integration Points
| File | Audio Path |
|------|------------|
| `Landing.tsx` | `/audio/greeting-en.mp3` |
| `LandingAr.tsx` | `/audio/greeting-ar.mp3` |

### Voice Greeting Flow
1. User visits landing page
2. After 4 seconds (or 50% scroll), greeting popup appears
3. Audio auto-plays (if browser allows)
4. User can toggle audio with speaker icon
5. "Let's Talk" button opens the chat

### Commit

## Future Enhancement: Dynamic TTS

The current implementation uses static audio files. For dynamic TTS in the future:

1. **Integrate a TTS service:**
   - ElevenLabs (high quality, natural voices)
   - AWS Polly
   - Google Cloud TTS

2. **Add backend endpoint:**
   ```python
   POST /api/v1/tts/generate
   {
     "text": "greeting message",
     "language": "en",
     "voice": "optional-voice-id"
   }
   ```

3. **Cache generated audio** to avoid repeated API calls

4. **Update VoiceGreeting component** to fetch audio dynamically

---

## Commands Used

### Docker
```bash
docker compose restart api
docker compose logs api --tail 5
```

### Git
```bash
git add backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/cdp.py
git commit -m "fix(cdp): fix route ordering bug..."
git add frontend/public/audio/
git commit -m "feat(voice): add TTS audio files..."
git push origin main
```

### TTS Generation
```python
import edge_tts
communicate = edge_tts.Communicate(text, voice)
await communicate.save('output.mp3')
```
