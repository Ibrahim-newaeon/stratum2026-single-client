# =============================================================================
# ADs Growth System - EMQ (Event Measurement Quality) Calculation Logic
# =============================================================================
"""
Real EMQ calculation logic that computes scores from platform metrics.

EMQ Score is composed of 5 drivers:
1. Event Match Rate (30%) - How well events match between pixel and CAPI
2. Pixel Coverage (25%) - Percentage of pages/events with pixel installed
3. Conversion Latency (20%) - Time delay in conversion reporting
4. Attribution Accuracy (15%) - Platform vs GA4 attribution alignment
5. Data Freshness (10%) - How recent the data is

Each driver scores 0-100, weighted to produce final EMQ score.
