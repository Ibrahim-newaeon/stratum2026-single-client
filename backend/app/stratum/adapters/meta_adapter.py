"""
ADs Growth System: Meta Marketing API Adapter
======================================

This adapter provides complete bi-directional integration with Meta's Marketing API,
enabling Stratum to both pull performance data and push automation changes to Facebook
and Instagram advertising campaigns.

Understanding Meta's API Hierarchy
----------------------------------

Meta organizes advertising entities in a strict hierarchy that mirrors how ads are
created in Ads Manager. At the top sits the Business Manager, which can contain
multiple Ad Accounts. Each Ad Account contains Campaigns, which in turn contain
Ad Sets, which finally contain individual Ads. This hierarchical structure means
that to create an ad, you must first have a campaign and ad set to place it in.

The key insight for automation is that budget optimization can happen at two levels:
Campaign Budget Optimization (CBO) centralizes budget decisions at the campaign level,
while Ad Set Budget Optimization (ABO) lets each ad set manage its own budget. Stratum
supports both approaches, automatically detecting which is in use.

Authentication Flow
-------------------

Meta's API uses OAuth 2.0 with several token types. For production automation like
Stratum, the recommended approach is System User tokens. Unlike user access tokens
that expire after 60 days of inactivity, System User tokens are tied to the Business
Manager itself and can be configured to never expire.

To set up System User authentication:
1. Navigate to Business Settings in Business Manager
2. Under System Users, create a new System User with Admin access
3. Click "Generate New Token" and select your app
4. Grant the following permissions: ads_management, ads_read, business_management
5. The generated token should be stored securely and provided to this adapter

Rate Limits
-----------

Meta calculates rate limits dynamically based on your app's tier and recent behavior.
The Marketing API uses a "call credit" system where different endpoints cost different
amounts. Simple reads might cost 1 credit, while complex insights queries might cost
10 or more. The standard tier allows approximately 4,800 credits per hour per ad account.

This adapter implements exponential backoff when rate limits are hit, automatically
retrying failed requests after progressively longer delays.
