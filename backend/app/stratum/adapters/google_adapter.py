ADs Growth System: Google Ads API Adapter
==================================

This adapter provides bi-directional integration with Google's Ads API, enabling
Stratum to manage Search, Display, Shopping, Performance Max, and Video campaigns
programmatically. Google's API is particularly powerful for automation because it
exposes nearly every setting available in the Google Ads web interface.

Understanding Google's API Architecture
---------------------------------------

Google Ads API differs from Meta's approach in several important ways. First, Google
uses a strongly-typed Protocol Buffer (protobuf) system rather than JSON. This means
requests and responses are defined by strict schemas, which catches errors at compile
time rather than runtime. The Python client library handles the protobuf translation
automatically, but you'll sometimes see references to "message types" and "field masks"
that reflect this underlying structure.

Second, Google uses a query language called GAQL (Google Ads Query Language) for
fetching data. GAQL looks similar to SQL but operates on Google Ads' resource types.
For example, to get campaigns with their budgets:

    SELECT campaign.id, campaign.name, campaign.campaign_budget
    FROM campaign
    WHERE campaign.status = 'ENABLED'

This query-based approach gives you precise control over what data you fetch, which
is important for staying within rate limits on large accounts.

Third, Google has a concept of "customer IDs" (also called CIDs) that represent the
10-digit account identifiers. When operating through a Manager Account (MCC), you
authenticate with the MCC but specify which customer ID to operate on. This makes
managing hundreds of client accounts from a single credential set straightforward.

Authentication Options
----------------------

Google Ads API supports three authentication flows:

1. Service Account (Recommended for automation): Create a service account in Google
   Cloud Console, download the JSON key file, and add the service account's email
   to your Google Ads account. This provides non-expiring credentials ideal for
   server-side automation.

2. OAuth Web Flow: For applications where users authorize their own accounts. The
   user goes through Google's OAuth consent screen, and you receive tokens to act
   on their behalf. Tokens need periodic refresh.

3. OAuth Desktop Flow: Similar to web flow but designed for installed applications.
   Uses a local redirect to capture the authorization code.

For Stratum's automated operations, we recommend the service account approach because
it eliminates token refresh complexity and works reliably for long-running processes.

Rate Limits
-----------

Google Ads API has daily operation limits based on your developer token tier:

- Basic Access: 10,000 operations per day (default for new tokens)
- Standard Access: 15,000 operations per day (after review)
- Advanced Access: Custom limits (requires business relationship)

Operations include both reads and writes. A single GAQL query counts as one operation
regardless of how many rows it returns. Batch operations count as one operation per
entity modified.

    Google Ads API adapter for Search, Display, Shopping, and Video campaigns.

    This adapter handles the complexity of Google's protobuf-based API, translating

        client_id: OAuth client ID from Google Cloud Console
        client_secret: OAuth client secret
