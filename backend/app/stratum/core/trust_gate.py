Trust Gate for Automation Decision Making.

The Trust Gate is the decision checkpoint that evaluates whether an
automation action should proceed based on current signal health.

Gate Decisions:
- PASS: Signal health is good, automation can execute
- HOLD: Signal health is degraded, alert but don't execute
- BLOCK: Signal health is critical, require manual intervention

The gate operates on the principle that automated budget decisions should
NEVER execute when data quality is compromised. This protects advertisers
from making costly mistakes based on unreliable signals.
