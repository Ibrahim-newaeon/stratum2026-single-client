"""
Checksum-based integrity verification for model .pkl files.

joblib.load deserializes (unpickles) whatever bytes are on disk — arbitrary-code
execution if the file is attacker-controlled. Uploads are already gated to
super admins (ML-003); this adds defense-in-depth on the LOAD path: each model
is written with a sidecar ``<file>.sha256`` at train/promote time, and the
loader verifies the file against it. A mismatch means the model was tampered
with or corrupted and is refused; a missing sidecar (e.g. a legacy model) is
loaded but logged as unverified so it can't be a silent bypass.
