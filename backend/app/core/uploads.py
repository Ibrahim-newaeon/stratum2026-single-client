"""
Helpers to bound request-body size on file-upload endpoints.

Reading an UploadFile with ``await file.read()`` loads the WHOLE body into
memory before any size check runs, so a large (or malicious) upload can OOM the
process before the cap is enforced. ``read_upload_capped`` streams in chunks and
aborts with 413 the moment the cap is exceeded, and ``enforce_content_length``
rejects early on the declared header.
