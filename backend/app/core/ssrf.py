"""
Shared guard for outbound HTTP requests to operator- or user-supplied URLs
(alert webhooks, CDN purge, notification/report webhooks, ...).

A scheme check alone is not enough: ``http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data``
(cloud metadata → credentials), ``http://10.0.0.5/`` (internal service), or a
public hostname whose DNS resolves to a private IP are all valid https/http
URLs. This module resolves the host and rejects any URL that resolves to a
private / loopback / link-local / reserved address.
