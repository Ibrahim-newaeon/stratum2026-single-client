# Stratum AI - Owner Endpoint Integration Tests
# =============================================================================
"""Integration tests for the platform Owner API under
``/api/v1/console/...``: revenue, tenant portfolio, system health, churn
risks, audit log, and billing reads. Every route is gated by an internal
``require_owner`` (reads ``request.state.role``).

NOTE: run with the session-scoped event loop CI uses
(``-o asyncio_default_test_loop_scope=session``).
