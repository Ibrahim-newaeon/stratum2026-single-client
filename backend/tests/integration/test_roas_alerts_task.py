# =============================================================================
# Stratum AI - ROAS Alert Task Integration Tests
# =============================================================================
"""
Integration tests for ``generate_roas_alerts`` and its dispatch from
``run_all_predictions``.

These guard the regression where the task called ``detect_anomalies`` with a
signature it never had (``campaign_id=``/an organization-scoping
kwarg/``metrics=``) and read dict keys off ``AnomalyResult`` objects — every
campaign raised ``TypeError``,
which was swallowed, so the task silently emitted zero alerts forever and was
never dispatched by the beat fan-out.

STRAT-SC-001 (Task C4/C6): ``generate_roas_alerts``/``run_all_predictions``
are tenant-free — there is exactly one organization, so campaigns are scored
globally rather than per-tenant. ``run_all_tenant_predictions`` was renamed
``run_all_predictions`` and no longer loops over tenants; it just dispatches
``run_live_predictions.delay()`` + ``generate_roas_alerts.delay()`` once.

The task uses ``SyncSessionLocal`` against the test DB, so rows are committed
via the sync engine (mirroring ``test_apply_actions_task``) and cleaned up in
teardown. WebSocket publishing (Redis pub/sub) is mocked.
