# =============================================================================
# ADs Growth System - Rules + Competitor Intelligence Shelving Tests
# =============================================================================
"""
Tests for shelving Automation Rules and Competitor Intelligence behind flags
(Tier 2 flag-off).

The rules beat evaluator reads ``rule.conditions`` while the model stores flat
``condition_field/operator/value`` columns (AttributeError every 15 min), and
the competitor refresh worker fabricates spend/impressions/CTR with
``random.randint`` (no real source wired). Both surfaces are gated off for
launch: the router deps return 503 while the flag is off (the default), and the
beat entries are absent from the schedule.
