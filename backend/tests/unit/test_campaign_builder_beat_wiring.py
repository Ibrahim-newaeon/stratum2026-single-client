# ADs Growth System - Campaign-Builder Beat Wiring Tests
# =============================================================================
"""
Tests for wiring the orphaned campaign-builder connector tasks (P1-2).

The tasks (ad-account sync, token refresh, connector health check) existed
but were never on the beat schedule, and the module wasn't in the Celery
`include` list. They hit live platform APIs, so they're gated behind
``enable_campaign_builder_beat`` (default off).
