"""Guard against beat-schedule entries that dispatch to nothing.

When ``app/workers/tasks.py`` was split into a package, the auto-generated
task names gained a submodule segment (``app.workers.tasks.rules.evaluate_all_rules``)
while the beat schedule kept the old flat names. Celery does not fail on
this: beat happily sends the message every interval and the worker logs an
"unregistered task" error, so five periodic pipelines were silently dead.
This test imports everything the worker would and asserts each beat entry
resolves to a registered task.
