# ADs Growth System - Pacing/Profit Route Prefix Tests
# =============================================================================
"""
Tests for removing the doubled URL prefix on the pacing and profit routers
(Tier 3, mechanical slice).

Both routers are mounted with a prefix (``/pacing`` / ``/profit``) yet several
routes ALSO started with that segment (``@router.get("/profit/roas")``),
yielding ``/api/v1/profit/profit/roas``. The routes are now relative so the
real endpoints sit at sane single-prefixed paths. (The deeper FE<->BE surface
reconcile — endpoints the FE calls that the BE never implemented — is a
separate follow-up.)
