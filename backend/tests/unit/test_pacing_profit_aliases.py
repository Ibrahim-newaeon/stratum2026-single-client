# =============================================================================
# ADs Growth System - Pacing/Profit Frontend-Alias Route Tests
# =============================================================================
"""
Tests for the frontend-compatibility route aliases (Tier 3, Pacing/Profit
reconcile — path half).

pacing.ts / profit.ts call endpoint names the backend never exposed
(/status, /summary, /targets/{id}/pacing, /alerts/stats; /true-roas,
/metrics/summary, /metrics/daily). Those are now registered as aliases of the
existing handlers via stacked route decorators, so the FE stops 404'ing.

(The response-envelope reconcile — the endpoints return {"status": ...} while
the FE expects {"success", "data"} — and the genuinely-missing endpoints
(reports CRUD, /kpis/daily, /products/{id}/margins) remain a separate follow-up
that needs a running frontend to validate.)
