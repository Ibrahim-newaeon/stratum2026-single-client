"""Unit tests for the FactSignalHealthDaily → stratum SignalHealth adapter
behind GET /trust/trust-gate and POST .../trust-gate/evaluate.

The adapter is the seam between the rolled-up daily table and the real
trust-gate engine; these lock in the safety default (no data blocks
automation) and the row mapping (EMQ rescale, worst-platform freshness).
