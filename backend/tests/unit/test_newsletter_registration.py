# =============================================================================
# ADs Growth System - Newsletter Task Registration Tests
# =============================================================================
"""
Tests for registering the newsletter task module (Tier 3).

``newsletter_tasks`` defined ``send_newsletter_campaign`` (dispatched by the
send endpoint via .delay) and ``process_scheduled_campaigns`` (a beat sweep),
but the module was never in the Celery ``include`` — so the worker never
registered the tasks and the endpoint's dispatch silently vanished. The module
is now included; the scheduled-send beat is gated behind ``enable_newsletter_beat``
(default off) since it sends live email.
