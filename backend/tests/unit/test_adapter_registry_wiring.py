# ADs Growth System - Adapter Registry Wiring Tests
# =============================================================================
"""
Tests for wiring the platform adapter registry (P1-5).

`register_default_adapters()` was defined but never called at startup, so
`AdapterRegistry` was always empty and the stratum action layer could not
resolve any platform adapter. It's now invoked in the app lifespan.
