# =============================================================================
# ADs Growth System - Drip + Campaign-Publish Flag-Off Tests
# =============================================================================
"""
Tests for shelving Drip Campaigns and Campaign Publish off for launch (Tier 2).

Drip has no execution engine (no drip Celery task; activate only flips a flag,
manual_trigger writes a "simulated" record), and campaign publish marks a draft
PUBLISHED with no platform call / no platform_campaign_id — a data-integrity
risk. Both are gated: the whole /drip-campaigns router 503s, and the single
publish endpoint 503s (draft CRUD stays available), while the flags are off
(the default).
