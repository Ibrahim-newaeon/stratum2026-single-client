# ADs Growth System - Knowledge Graph Shelving Tests
# =============================================================================
"""
Tests for shelving the Knowledge Graph behind a feature flag (P1-6).

The KG depends on the Apache AGE Postgres extension, which is not
provisioned. The router-level gate must return 503 when the flag is off
(the default) and allow requests through when it is explicitly enabled.
