# Stratum AI - Action Approver Serialization Tests
# =============================================================================
"""
Tests for the accountability surface on the actions API: _approver_info /
action_to_response serialize which user accepted an autopilot action
(name + department). The approver relationship is only touched when
eager-loaded — a lazy load would raise under the async session — so the
guard behavior matters as much as the happy path.
