"""
Regression tests for the audit-log pipeline (P0-3).

The middleware (producer) and the ``process_audit_log_queue`` worker
(consumer) previously hardcoded *different* Redis keys
(``audit_log_queue`` vs ``audit:log:queue``), so every audited event was
silently dropped. Both must now reference the single shared constant.
