# Release-phase database bootstrap [INF-011]: migrations, varchar→enum casts,
# owner role backfill, and optional seeds. Extracted from start.sh so the
# whole block runs under a single Postgres advisory lock
# (scripts/with_pg_lock.py). That serializes concurrent API replicas — before
# this, every replica ran `alembic upgrade head` at once on boot, racing the
# alembic_version row and the DDL/UPDATE statements below.
#
# Safe to run repeatedly and concurrently: alembic upgrade is a no-op at head,
# the cast/role steps check for existence first, and the seeds are idempotent.
# Assumes DATABASE_URL_SYNC is exported by the caller (start.sh).
