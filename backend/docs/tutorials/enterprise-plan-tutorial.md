### 4.3 Model Overview

**Model Metrics:**

| Metric | Description | Target |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Accuracy | Overall correctness | > 85% |
| Precision | Correct churn predictions | > 80% |
| Recall | Actual churners caught | > 90% |
| AUC-ROC | Model discrimination | > 0.90 |

### 4.4 Understanding Churn Scores

Each profile receives a churn probability (0-100%):

| Score | Risk Level | Recommended Action |
|-------|------------|-------------------|
| 0-25% | Low | Monitor, standard engagement |
| 25-50% | Medium | Proactive outreach |
| 50-75% | High | Urgent intervention |
| 75-100% | Critical | Immediate action required |

### 4.5 Churn Factors

The model identifies top factors driving churn:

**Common Churn Indicators:**

| Factor | Impact Direction | Example |
|--------|------------------|---------|
| Days since last purchase | Increases churn | 45 days = high risk |
| Support tickets | Increases churn | 4+ open tickets |
| Email open rate | Decreases churn | <10% = risk |
| Feature usage decline | Increases churn | -60% usage |
| Contract end proximity | Increases churn | <30 days |
| NPS score | Decreases churn | Score 4 vs 9 |

### 4.6 Setting Up Retention Campaigns

**Step 1: Create At-Risk Segment**
```yaml
Segment: High Churn Risk
Conditions:
