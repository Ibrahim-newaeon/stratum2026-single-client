## 2. Funnel Builder

### 2.1 What is Funnel Analysis?

Funnel analysis helps you understand how customers move through your conversion process, identifying where they drop off and opportunities for optimization.

### 2.2 Accessing the Funnel Builder

Navigate to **CDP > Funnels** (`/dashboard/cdp/funnels`)

### 2.3 Creating Your First Funnel

**Step 1: Define Funnel Steps**

1. Click **Create Funnel**
2. Enter a funnel name (e.g., "Purchase Funnel")
3. Add steps in order:

```
Example E-commerce Funnel:
Step 1: page_view (Landing Page)
Step 2: view_content (Product Page)
Step 3: add_to_cart
Step 4: initiate_checkout
Step 5: purchase
```

**Step 2: Configure Step Settings**

For each step, configure:
- **Event Name**: The event that qualifies for this step
- **Event Properties** (optional): Filter by specific properties
- **Time Window**: Maximum time to complete funnel

**Step 3: Set Analysis Parameters**

| Parameter | Description | Recommended |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Conversion Window | Max time from first to last step | 7-30 days |
| Counting Method | Unique users vs. total events | Unique users |
| Date Range | Analysis period | Last 30 days |

### 2.4 Understanding Funnel Metrics

| Metric | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| Conversion Rate | % completing the funnel |
| Drop-off Rate | % leaving at each step |
| Avg. Time to Convert | Average completion time |
| Step Conversion | % moving to next step |

### 2.5 Funnel Visualization

The funnel visualization shows:
- **Bar Chart**: Users at each step
- **Drop-off Indicators**: Red arrows showing losses
- **Conversion Percentages**: Step-to-step rates

**Example Output:**
```
Step 1: Page View       10,000 users (100%)
    ↓ 60% convert, 40% drop-off
Step 2: View Content     6,000 users (60%)
    ↓ 50% convert, 50% drop-off
Step 3: Add to Cart      3,000 users (30%)
    ↓ 40% convert, 60% drop-off
Step 4: Checkout         1,200 users (12%)
    ↓ 75% convert, 25% drop-off
Step 5: Purchase           900 users (9%)

Overall Conversion: 9%
```

### 2.6 Funnel Breakdown

Segment your funnel by:
- **Platform**: Meta vs. Google traffic
- **Device**: Mobile vs. Desktop
- **Campaign**: Specific campaign performance
- **Segment**: CDP segments

### 2.7 Funnel Insights

The AI-powered insights feature identifies:
- Steps with unusually high drop-off
- Time periods with poor performance
- Segments that convert better/worse
- Recommended optimizations

## 3. Computed Traits

### 3.1 What are Computed Traits?

Computed Traits are dynamic customer attributes calculated from behavior data. They automatically update as new events arrive.

### 3.2 Accessing Computed Traits

Navigate to **CDP > Computed Traits** (`/dashboard/cdp/computed-traits`)

### 3.3 Creating a Computed Trait

**Step 1: Choose Trait Type**

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Aggregation | Sum, count, average | Total purchases |
| Most Frequent | Mode value | Favorite category |
| First/Last | Temporal value | First purchase date |
| Unique Count | Distinct values | Products viewed |

**Step 2: Configure the Trait**

Example: Creating "Total Spend (30 Days)"

```yaml
Name: total_spend_30d
Type: Aggregation
Aggregation: SUM
Event: purchase
Property: revenue
Time Window: 30 days
Update Frequency: Daily
```

**Step 3: Set Conditions (Optional)**

Add filters to narrow the calculation:
- Event properties
- Time constraints
- Profile attributes

### 3.4 Computed Trait Examples

**Example 1: Purchase Frequency**
```yaml
Name: purchase_frequency_30d
Type: Aggregation
Aggregation: COUNT
Event: purchase
Time Window: 30 days
```

**Example 2: Favorite Product Category**
```yaml
Name: favorite_category
Type: Most Frequent
Event: purchase
Property: category
Time Window: 90 days
```

**Example 3: Days Since Last Purchase**
```yaml
Name: days_since_purchase
Type: Last
Event: purchase
Property: timestamp
Calculation: DAYS_SINCE
```

**Example 4: Average Order Value**
```yaml
Name: average_order_value
Type: Aggregation
Aggregation: AVG
Event: purchase
Property: revenue
Time Window: All time
```

### 3.5 Using Computed Traits

Once created, computed traits can be used in:
- **Segmentation**: Build segments based on trait values
- **Personalization**: Tailor messaging
- **Analysis**: Group profiles by trait
- **CRM Sync**: Push traits to Pipedrive

### 3.6 Trait Management

- **Backfill**: Calculate trait for existing profiles
- **Preview**: See sample calculations before saving
- **Versioning**: Track trait definition changes
- **Dependencies**: View segments using this trait

## 4. Trust Gate Audit Logs

### 4.1 What are Trust Gate Audit Logs?

Audit logs provide a complete history of all Trust Gate decisions, showing when and why automations were allowed or blocked.

### 4.2 Accessing Audit Logs

Navigate to **Data Quality > Audit Logs** or through the Trust Layer section.

### 4.3 Audit Log Entry Structure

Each log entry contains:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Timestamp | When the decision was made |
| Action Type | What automation was attempted |
| Decision | PASS, HOLD, or BLOCK |
| Signal Health | Health score at decision time |
| Reason | Explanation for the decision |
| Entity | Campaign/Ad Set/Creative affected |
| User | Who initiated (if manual) |

### 4.4 Understanding Decisions

**PASS Decision:**
```json
{
  "decision": "PASS",
  "signal_health": 85,
  "reason": "All signals healthy, automation approved",
  "action": "budget_increase",
  "entity": "Campaign: Summer Sale 2026",
  "change": "+15% budget"
}
```

**HOLD Decision:**
```json
{
  "decision": "HOLD",
  "signal_health": 62,
  "reason": "Signal health below threshold (70), action queued for manual review",
  "action": "pause_adset",
  "entity": "Ad Set: Retargeting - Cart Abandoners"
}
```

**BLOCK Decision:**
```json
{
  "decision": "BLOCK",
  "signal_health": 35,
  "reason": "Critical signal degradation, automation blocked",
  "action": "scale_budget",
  "entity": "Campaign: Brand Awareness Q1",
  "blocked_reason": "EMQ score 3.2 (below 4.0 threshold)"
}
```

### 4.5 Filtering Audit Logs

Filter logs by:
- **Date Range**: Last 7 days, 30 days, custom
- **Decision Type**: PASS, HOLD, BLOCK
- **Action Type**: Budget changes, pauses, etc.
- **Entity**: Specific campaigns or ad sets
- **Signal Health Range**: e.g., only show < 70

### 4.6 Audit Log Analytics

2. Toggle **Dry-Run Mode** ON
3. All automations will simulate only

**Method 2: Per-Action**
1. Navigate to **Autopilot > Action Queue**
2. Find the action you want to test
3. Click **Test (Dry-Run)** instead of **Approve**

### 5.3 Dry-Run Results

A dry-run shows:

```
DRY-RUN RESULTS
===============
Action: Increase budget by 20%
Entity: Campaign "Holiday Promo 2026"
Current Budget: $500/day
Proposed Budget: $600/day

Pre-flight Checks:
✓ Signal Health: 88 (PASS)
✓ Budget Cap: $600 < $1000 limit (PASS)
