## 1. Platform Overview

ADs Growth System is a **Revenue Operating System** with a Trust-Gated Autopilot architecture. It combines campaign management, customer data, analytics, and intelligent automation into a single platform.

### Core Concept: Trust-Gated Automation

```
Signal Health Check  -->  Trust Gate  -->  Automation Decision
       |                     |                    |
  [HEALTHY 70+]         [PASS]            [EXECUTE automatically]
  [DEGRADED 40-69]      [HOLD]            [ALERT ONLY - review needed]
  [UNHEALTHY <40]       [BLOCK]           [MANUAL REQUIRED]
```

The platform monitors signal health (data quality) and only allows automated actions when trust thresholds are met. This protects budgets from executing on unreliable data.

### Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Frontend | React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS |
| Backend | Python 3.11+, FastAPI, Pydantic |
| Database | PostgreSQL 16 |
| Cache/Queue | Redis 7 |
| Background Jobs | Celery + Redis |
